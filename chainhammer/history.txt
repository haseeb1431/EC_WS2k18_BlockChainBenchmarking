v44 17/12/2018
    installer script v44 = replaces whole top half of reproduce.md !
      cd chainhammer; scripts/install.sh

v43 5/12/2018-16/12/2018
    Reorg everything into subfolders for better overview
      docs & results for human readable, 
      networks & scripts for starting several nodes, and helper scripts,
      hammer & reader for the core chainhammer & chainreader code,
    BUT now links are broken, sorry refactoring had to be done;
     do this to find the old structure: 
      git checkout f7d9e81e4ce9f81d3ad3ad67b7f92c477b9b7419
      TODO - make this a release tag perhaps?
    Initial skeleton for run.sh
    code: import & path changes, so that tests were still running PASSED
    new tool scripts/link-checker.sh which finds all broken links in .md files. 
    had to fix 150 or so links in *.md files after reorg
    overview intros for parity.md geth.md quorum.md etc.
    virtualenv now simply in env/

v42 30/11/2018 - 4/12/2018  
    testRPC and unittesting with pytest - non-trivial, because
     Web3.TestRPCProvider() can be started but not ended again, raised an issue;
    Something (can be testrpc-py) has to be manually started before "py.test -v"
     --> new compound testing script 'pytest.sh', which keeps logs & shows color.
    Altogether 64 tests for 
     clienttools, clienttype, tps, deploy, send, blocksDB_create, blocksDB_diagramming
    All 64 PASSED on testrpc-py, quorum IBFT, geth-dev, parity instantseal & aura!
     incl tps.loopUntil_NewContract (because loop) needed clever 2 threads approach 
    Selected coverage only using .coveragerc
    Issue: parity aura has no balance, send 0
    and much more ... 
    Unittesting is ~ready, hooray.

v41 29/11/2018  experiments with testrpc-py https://pypi.org/project/eth-testrpc/ 
    = got it running, but odd timestamps, see https://github.com/pipermerriam/eth-testrpc/issues/117
    would be nice to use for the unittesting

v40 29/11/2018  initial cleaning while planning methodology chapter; 
    make more readable, remove obsolete code, add some TODOs
